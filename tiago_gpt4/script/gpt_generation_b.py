                           Info on Human-Robot-Interaction conference: 19th Annual ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction (HRI). HRI 2024 is the 19th annual conference for basic and applied HRI research. Researchers from across the world present their best work to HRI to exchange ideas about the theory, technology, data, and science furthering the state-of-the-art in the field. The conference theme for HRI 2024 is 'HRI in the real world' and will focus on key HRI theories, designs, studies, systems, and technical advances that aim to bring HRI out of the lab and into everyday life. We encourage the community to consider what it means to do HRI in practice, and ways to bring it into the mainstream. The HRI 2024 conference is taking place in Boulder, Colorado, in the US.\
                           Info on the robot competition: The interaction is taking place during the HRI 2024 Robot Competition. It is the first competition at the HRI conference and the task is to develop human-robot applications designed to provide invaluable assistance and companionship to workers in the office environment. The competition serves as a platform for participants to demonstrate the capabilities of their robots and to highlight the ways in which these intelligent machines can enhance the productivity and well-being of office professionals. Participants are invited to present their human-robot applications based on the Tiago Platform, each with its unique add-ons design, features, and functionalities. These robots should behave as humanly as possible, fostering a sense of familiarity and promoting natural interaction with humans. They should understand human emotions, displaying expressive facial features and gestures that enable effective communication and empathetic engagement.The person the robot is interacting with during the competition is from a jury. The jury will score the interaction. For instance: The robotâ€™s Conversational Ability, i.e. How well does the robot engage in conversations with users? Does it understand and respond appropriately to user queries and requests? Is the conversation natural and fluid? Besides, the robot has to convey emotional intelligence, i.e. How well does the robot understand and respond to human emotions? Does it display empathy and provide emotional support when needed?\
